Positive Habits will provide you with rewards, like Gold and Experience (Exp), while Negative Habits will cause you to lose health points (HP).\\n\\nDailies are repeated tasks you want to complete on a more structured schedule. E.g. Once per day, three times a week, or four times a month. Missing Dailies causes you to lose HP, but the more difficult they are, the better the rewards!\\n\\nTo Do’s are one-off tasks that provide rewards after you complete them. To Do’s can have a due date, but you won’t lose HP if you miss it.\\n\\nPick the task type that best fits what you want to achieve!","faqQuestion26":"What are some sample tasks?","webFaqAnswer26":"Positive Habits (Behaviors you want to encourage; should have a plus button)\\n\\n * Take vitamins\\n * Floss teeth\\n * One hour of studying\\n\\nNegative Habits (Behaviors you want to limit or avoid; should have a minus button)\\n\\n * Smoking\\n * Doom scrolling\\n * Biting nails\\n\\nDual Habits (Habits that involve a positive vs. negative option; should have both plus and minus buttons)\\n\\n * Drink water vs. drink soda\\n * Study vs. procrastinate\\n\\nSample Dailies (Tasks you want to repeat on a regular schedule)\\n * Wash dishes\\n * Water plants\\n * 30 minutes of physical activity\\n\\nSample To Do’s (Tasks you only need to do once)\\n\\n * Schedule appointment\\n * Organize closet\\n * Finish essay","faqQuestion27":"Why do tasks change color?","webFaqAnswer27":"The color of a task is a visual representation of the task’s value. All tasks start as yellow for neutral, blue is better, and red is worse. Here’s how each task type determines the task’s value:\\n\\nHabits become more blue or red based on whether you tap the plus or minus button. Positive and negative Habits degrade to yellow over time if you don’t complete them. Dual Habits only change color based on your inputs.\\n\\nDailies change color based on how often they are completed, becoming more blue as they’re completed or more red if they’re missed.\\n\\nTo Do’s gradually get more red the longer they stay incomplete.\\n\\nThe more red the task, the more Gold and Exp you’ll earn for completing it, so be sure to take on even your toughest tasks!","faqQuestion28":"Can I pause my Dailies if I need a break?","webFaqAnswer28":"Yes! The “Pause Damage” button can be found in Settings. It will prevent you from losing HP for missed Dailies. This is helpful if you are on vacation, need a rest, or for any other reason you might need a break. If you are participating in a Quest, your own pending progress will be paused, but you will still take damage from your Party member’s missed Dailies.\\n\\nTo pause specific Dailies, you can edit the scheduling to make it due every 0 days until you’re ready to restart it.","faqQuestion29":"How do I recover HP?","webFaqAnswer29":"You can recover 15 HP by purchasing a Health Potion from your Rewards column for 25 Gold. Additionally, you will always recover full HP when you level up!","faqQuestion30":"What happens when I run out of HP?","webFaqAnswer30":"If your HP reaches zero, you’ll lose one level, all of your Gold, and a piece of Equipment that can be repurchased.","faqQuestion31":"Why did I lose HP when interacting with a non-negative task?","webFaqAnswer31":"If you complete a task and lose HP when you shouldn’t have, you encountered a delay while the server is syncing changes made on other platforms. For example, if you use Gold, Mana, or lose HP on the mobile app and then complete a task on the website, the server is simply confirming everything is in sync.","faqQuestion32":"When can I choose a class?","webFaqAnswer32":"There are four classes in Habitica: Warrior, Mage, Rogue, and Healer.

Tavern and Guilds helped motivate players by helping them find others with similar goals. Some truly wonderful spaces were created and we had a chance to see the community thrive with helpful discussion. As the years passed, we noticed changes in how players use and rely on Habitica. Parties flourished, while Guilds and public spaces were used by less and less of our player base. In an ever changing internet landscape, the resources necessary to maintain these spaces became too disproportionate to the number of people actually participating in them.","sunsetFaqPara3":"We’re making this decision so we can better focus our resources on the parts of Habitica players rely on most without disrupting anyone’s access.","sunsetFaqPara4":"To celebrate the times we’ve had, we will be gifting everyone a Veteran Pet as we move forward into this new era. For our amazing contributors, we’ll also be sending out a special gear set to commemorate all their hard work in Habitica’s communities.","sunsetFaqPara5":"If you’d like to know more about what\'s changing, you can read the details below.","sunsetFaqHeader1":"Which services are ending?","sunsetFaqPara6":"Service for Tavern as well as public and private Guilds is ending and these spaces will be removed from Habitica on <strong>August 8, 2023</strong>.","sunsetFaqHeader2":"Why are the Tavern and Guild services ending?","sunsetFaqList1":"Habitica’s primary purpose is to provide motivation through a gamified task management experience. Guilds and Tavern are utilized by a disproportionately small percentage of our player base. The majority of players use outside services that are primarily intended for social interaction and are intentionally designed and maintained with those use cases in mind.","sunsetFaqList2":"New online safety laws require a level of active content oversight for public spaces that Habitica has historically not provided. Investing in the features that these new regulations would require would result in our limited resources being redirected towards parts of Habitica that the vast majority of players never touch.","sunsetFaqList3":"It’s important to us to continue offering worldwide access to Habitica’s ever-growing international player base. Removing these services allows us to continue that goal without having to consider restricting access in regions where more active content oversight than we can provide is required.","sunsetFaqHeader3":"Will I still be able to talk with my Party or Group Plan members?","sunsetFaqPara7":"Parties and Group Plans will remain and retain their chat spaces. You’ll also still be able to send private messages.","sunsetFaqHeader4":"Where do I go to pause my Dailies?","sunsetFaqPara8":"This feature has been relocated to Settings.

Blacksmith collaboration and discussion has largely taken place over GitHub and that will continue.","sunsetFaqPara14":"<strong>Linguists</strong><br />We continue to welcome help with translating the apps and website and will still be awarding contributor tiers for qualifying contributions. However, the method with which we accept translations will be changing. We’d like to focus our resources on supporting a set selection of languages across all platforms. To do this, we will be reducing the amount of languages available for translation. Previously unfinished languages will be archived in Github.

We are extremely grateful for the work that our friendly and helpful players have done answering questions in our chat spaces.","sunsetFaqPara17":"<strong>Comrades</strong><br />Scripts and add-ons are helpful to a shrinking section of our user base as the mobile apps increasingly become the only way that most users access Habitica. Contributors wishing to create 3rd party tools to customize their Habitica experience can continue doing so, but we will no longer be awarding Comrade tiers as we focus on contributions that enhance Habitica in a way that is accessible to our player base as a whole.","sunsetFaqPara18":"<strong>Artisans</strong><br />We are discontinuing artisan contributions. Most art production has already been moved in-house to keep up with our content releases. We are deeply grateful for the fantastic art made over the years by our contributor community.","sunsetFaqPara19":"<strong>Wiki Wizards</strong><br />The Habitica Wiki is a wonderful tool created by players for players that has helped so many. We continue to support this effort, but will no longer be tracking or offering tiers for Wiki editing as we shift our focus towards Linguist, Blacksmith, and Challenger contributions within Habitica.","sunsetFaqHeader9":"How will Challenges be affected?","sunsetFaqList4":"Public Challenges will continue as a feature in Habitica and will be accessible via the Challenges section.","sunsetFaqList5":"Challenges based in Parties and Group Plans will remain and be unaffected by the end of Tavern and Guild services.","sunsetFaqList6":"Challenges that are currently hosted in Guilds will remain accessible to current participants from their Challenges list, but will not be discoverable in the public list due to privacy concerns. It will not be possible to create new Guild-based Challenges.","sunsetFaqList7":"Currently many Challenges have tasks that require posts in Habitica’s public chat spaces.

The following images can be used for articles or videos about Habitica. For more information, please contact us at <%= pressEnquiryEmail %>.","pkQuestion1":"What inspired Habitica? How did it start?","pkAnswer1":"If you’ve ever invested time in leveling up a character in a game, it’s hard not to wonder how great your life would be if you put all of that effort into improving your real-life self instead of your avatar. We starting building Habitica to address that question. <br /> Habitica officially launched with a Kickstarter in 2013, and the idea really took off. Since then, it’s grown into a huge project, supported by our awesome open-source volunteers and our generous users.","pkQuestion2":"Why does Habitica work?","pkAnswer2":"Forming a new habit is hard because people really need that obvious, instant reward. For example, it’s tough to start flossing, because even though our dentist tells us that it\'s healthier in the long run, in the immediate moment it just makes your gums hurt. <br /> Habitica\'s gamification adds a sense of instant gratification to everyday objectives by rewarding a tough task with experience, gold… and maybe even a random prize, like a dragon egg! This helps keep people motivated even when the task itself doesn\'t have an intrinsic reward, and we\'ve seen people turn their lives around as a result.","pkQuestion3":"Why did you add social features?","pkAnswer3":"Social pressure is a huge motivating factor for a lot of people, so we knew that we wanted to have a strong community that would hold each other accountable for their goals and cheer for their successes. Luckily, one of the things that multiplayer video games do best is foster a sense of community among their users! Habitica’s community structure borrows from these types of games. Although some users choose to play solo, most decide to form a support network in a small Party of close friends that encourages social accountability through features such as Quests, where Party members pool their productivity to battle monsters together.","pkQuestion4":"Why does skipping tasks remove your avatar’s health?","pkAnswer4":"If you skip one of your daily goals, your avatar will lose health the following day. This serves as an important motivating factor to encourage people to follow through with their goals because people  really hate hurting their little avatar! Plus, the social accountability is critical for a lot of people: if you’re fighting a monster with your friends, skipping your tasks hurts their avatars, too.","pkQuestion5":"What distinguishes Habitica from other gamification programs?","pkAnswer5":"One of the ways that Habitica has been most successful at using gamification is that we\'ve put a lot of effort into thinking about the game aspects to ensure that they are actually fun. We\'ve also included many social components, because we feel that some of the most motivating games let you play with friends, and because research has shown that it\'s easier to form habits when you have accountability to other people.","pkQuestion6":"Who is the typical user of Habitica?","pkAnswer6":"Lots of different people use Habitica! More than half of our users are ages 18 to 34, but we have grandparents using the site with their young grandkids and every age in-between. Often families will join a party and battle monsters together. <br /> Many of our users have a background in games, but surprisingly, when we ran a survey a while back, 40% of our users identified as non-gamers! So it looks like our method can be effective for anyone who wants productivity and wellness to feel more fun.","pkQuestion7":"Why does Habitica use pixel art?","pkAnswer7":"Habitica uses pixel art for several reasons. In addition to the fun nostalgia factor, pixel art is very approachable to our volunteer artists who want to chip in. It\'s much easier to keep our pixel art consistent even when lots of different artists contribute, and it lets us quickly generate a ton of new content!","pkQuestion8":"How has Habitica affected people\'s real lives?","pkAnswer8":"You can find lots of testimonials for how Habitica has helped people here: https://habitversary.tumblr.com","pkMoreQuestions":"Do you have a question that’s not on this list?
